    "lyrics": "Time's moving so much slower lately\r\nIt's like the world's playing a joke\r\nLaughing at me for falling foolishly again\r\nBut something's different\r\nWith you\n\nTraffic on Sunset doesn't faze me\n\nI'm just unusually composed\n\nThat is until I touch you and I can't pretend\n\nI lose myself again\n\nI do\n\n\n\nI'm all in, I'm falling\n\nCan't get back up\n\nCan't think right\n\nToo tongue-tied\n\nIt must be love\n\n\n\nFriends asking me where I've been hiding\n\nI'm losing hours in your eyes\n\nLost in your wonderland, I hope I'm never found\n\nThere's no one else around\n\nTonight\n\n\n\nI'm not so used to being happy\n\nNow I just float down every street\n\nYou made a sappy, stupid something out of me\n\nThe kind I swore I'd never be\n\nI'm awake inside a dream\n\n\n\nI'm all in, I'm falling\n\nCan't get back up\n\nCan't think right\n\nToo tongue-tied\n\nCome kiss me\n\nConvince me\n\nThis must be\n\nIt must be love\n\nMust be love"
