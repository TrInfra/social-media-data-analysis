    "lyrics": "Look at me\r\nI'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree\r\nAnd I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud\r\nI can't understand\r\nI get misty, just holding your hand\n\nMisty, walk my way\n\nAnd a thousand violins begin to play\n\nOr it might be the sound of your hello\n\nThat music I hear\n\nI get misty, the moment you're near\n\n\n\nCan't you see that you're leading me on?\n\nAnd it's just what I want you to do\n\nDon't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost?\n\nThat's why I'm following you\n\nFollowing you\n\n\n\nOn my own\n\nWould I wander through this wonderland alone?\n\nNever knowing my right foot from my left\n\nMy hat from my glove\n\nI'm too misty, and too much in love\n\n\n\nToo misty\n\nAnd too much in love"
