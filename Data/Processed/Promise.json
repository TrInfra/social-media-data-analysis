    "lyrics": "I made a promise\r\nTo distance myself\r\nTook a flight, through aurora skies\r\nHonestly, I didn't think about\r\nHow we didn't say goodbye\r\nJust, \"See you very soon\"\n\n\n\nIt hurts to be something\n\nIt's worse to be nothing with you\n\nMm, mm-mm, mm\n\n\n\nSo I didn't call you\n\nFor sixteen long days\n\nAnd I should get a cigarette\n\nFor so much restraint\n\nNo matter how long I resist temptation\n\nI will always lose\n\n\n\nIt hurts to be something\n\nIt's worse to be nothing with you\n\n\n\nI've done the math\n\nThere's no solution\n\nWe'll never last\n\nWhy can't I let go of this?\n\n\n\nSo I broke my promise\n\nI called you last night\n\nI shouldn't have, I wouldn't have\n\nIf it weren't for the sight\n\nOf a boy who lookd just like you\n\nStanding out on Melrose Avnue\n\n\n\nIt hurts to be something\n\nIt's worse to be nothing with you\n\nMm, mm-mm, mm\n\n\n\nIt hurts to be something\n\nIt's worse to be nothing with you"
